            Hello! My name is Triston Golden for those of you visiting this
            webpage. As you read along throughout this webpage I will continue
            to open up about myself and share with you some details that will
            help you get to know me better. With that being said, I welcome you
            to learn a little about me. I'm the oldest of five children, which
            needless to say I try my best to lead by example. I graduated from
            Shiloh High School in Gwinnett county. I did wrestling and football
            year round. I got my first real job at my local McDonald's. During
            my college days I loved to play Madden and NBA 2K as well as play
            recreational basketball at my local LA Fitness. At one point I was a
            top 1,500 Madden NFL player in the world on the playstation 4. I
            can't forget about NBA 2K though! I very much enjoyed creating my
            own myplayer build, as well as being yelled at by 3rd graders about
            how bad I was at the game.

            As I mentioned earlier, my first job was at McDonald's. When I moved
            to college I was able to essentially transfer to a closer McDonald's
            in the city of Kennesaw.

            During my time at Kennesaw State I was a full time student, and also
            I worked for a local Homegoods and work study position. I pretty
            much worked these two jobs throughout my entire tenure at Kennesaw
            State.

            During my second to last semester of college I was hired at AT&T,
            where I worked for a little over 3 years.
          </p>

            I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at Georgia Tech with an
            end date of March 9th, 2022. I hope to take the skills I've aquired
            during my bootcamp and find a job in a related field.
